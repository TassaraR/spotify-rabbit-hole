#### Displays a hierarchical graph of related artists and their tracks generated by using Spotify's REST API.

The name and concept of the app comes from the term *"Going down the `Rabbit Hole`"* which can
roughly translate to *"being deeply involved in a certain topic and being unable to leave"*.
So you end up spiraling down to other topics revolving around the original one for hours.

#### How does the app work and what does it display?

The app was originally created as a playlist generator for Spotify. 
This graphical implementation of the app displays information of the results its underlying algorithm creates.

The current implementation does not allow the user of this app to create new queries.
So a sample dataset (created with the app) is used for showcasing its results. 

Given a `base artist` (The Beatles in this case) extract $n$ similar artists and $n$ similiar
artists from those artists and so on until an user-defined limit is reached. For every artist
extract $k$ of its most popular tracks.
